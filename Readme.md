## ChatOwls

### Description

[![Koding Hackathon](images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

The idea was to create an app to allow users to write messages in their language of choice and have those messages sent to the recipient and translated in the receipient's language of choice. 

For example, you would write a message in your language of choice (i.e your native language) and the message will be sent to your friend and translated for your friend, in his/her own langauge of choice (i.e her/his native language).

In summary, the application will allow people who do not speak the same language to still be able to communicate. 
Additionally, using interactive data visualization we would indicate the source and the destination of a message. 
With this premise, we believe the application would address theme #5 and #1.
